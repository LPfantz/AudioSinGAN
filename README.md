This project is my Masters Thesis being defended 12/3/2021. It is heavily based on and contains code from SinGAN. The purpose of this project is to extend SinGAN into the audio domain. Check out the original code / paper here: https://github.com/tamarott/SinGAN.

Link to my audio samples of my project here: https://sites.google.com/view/audiosingan/

A dataset of resulting audio clips and my thesis can be found here: https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/82595/Pfantz_Thesis_Final.pdf

If you run this project please run it from the colab notebook included in this repo. It will be much easier as I never set this up to be run locally.
